# Government-Spending-Insights-in-Alberta
Analyzed 2023–2024 Alberta government grant payments to identify top funding ministries, key beneficiaries, and supported program types. Insights reflect real disbursements, revealing spending priorities and transparency.

# Discussion
This analysis examines Alberta’s 2023–2024 grant distributions, highlighting key trends that reflect the government’s priorities, as well as areas of lower priority that may suggest opportunities for more balanced allocation. A sharp spike in monthly disbursements occurred in November, likely due to fiscal deadlines. Health-related ministries dominated funding, receiving 70% of total allocations, led by the Ministry of Health (58%), followed by Education (21.4%). These figures emphasize the province’s prioritization of the Health and Education sectors.
Top-funded programs in healthcare are the Primary Care Physician Compensation and Diagnostic & Therapeutic Services. In contrast, underfunded initiatives were primarily related to administrative or restructuring efforts within Health and Social Wellbeing. The Public Safety and Justice sector received the lowest allocation, suggesting a lack of initiatives or active programs in this area.
Major recipients included Alberta Health Services, universities, and municipalities such as Calgary. For instance, the University of Calgary received grants primarily aimed at supporting education and skill development (75%), as well as student health and social wellbeing.
Future analyses could investigate multi-year trends, the effectiveness of funding, geographic and demographic equity, and sectors that remain underfunded—such as Public Safety.
